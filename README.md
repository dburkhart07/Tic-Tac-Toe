# Tic-Tac-Toe
Uses minimax algorithm to create an AI Tic-tac-toe opponent
(main START) in the command window to start the game.
Brings up a board, with the computer starting at difficulty 0
(making moves randomly). Pressing numbers 1-9 enhances the
difficulty, using the minimax algorithm to look into future
boards with one depth per difficulty. Difficulty 1 will
win if given the chance, difficulty 2 will do difficulty 1 and 
block you if it can, etc. At a high enough difficulty, the
computer becomes unbeatable.
